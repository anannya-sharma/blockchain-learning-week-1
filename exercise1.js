// Question 1
// Declare variables to represent your name, age, and city of residence, and log them to the console.

// using const for name as name can not be changed and that what const helps us with. We can not reassign & redeclare it
const NAME = "Anannya Sharma";

let age = 23; // block scope

var city = "Noida"; // global scope

console.log("Name:", NAME);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("City:", city);
